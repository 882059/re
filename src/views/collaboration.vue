On July 18, we attended <strong>the Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development Summit </strong>hosted by NNU-CHINA. On August 5, NNU-CHINA participated in the academic forum on <strong>Bioremediation</strong> organized by us. On August 19, we met at <strong>the 14th China Enzyme Engineering Symposium</strong> and exchanged views on the progress of the project. Through constant communication, we can clearly discover the <strong>subtleties</strong> of their team project design and teamwork, and then compare ourselves and make <strong>continuous progress</strong>.</p><p>In addition, we jointly designed a <strong>questionnaire </strong>with NNU-CHINA. Through cooperation, we can obtain samples from <strong>different regions and different groups</strong>, broaden <strong>the breadth and depth </strong>of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://research.It">research.It</a> is also a good way to improve<strong> the</strong> <strong>representativeness and credibility </strong>of the research, and improve <strong>the progress and efficiency</strong> of the research.</p><image-pro><image-pro src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4591/wiki/wikibreezeupload/collaboration/coll1/39e674c3fe29c0dd5ca91bf0b914ebe33d1acc95.jpg"></image-pro><p><strong>Fig. 6. </strong>Photo with NNU-China</p></image-pro><image-pro><image-pro src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4591/wiki/wikibreezeupload/collaboration/coll1/c70c006d9f02de1c9dd5d70634b43b2b6c35268e.jpg"></image-pro><p><strong>Fig. 7. </strong>Post-meeting exchange</p></image-pro><image-pro><image-pro src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4591/wiki/wikibreezeupload/collaboration/coll1/85861d6d1070890fafe6f9772fac7e08e11a1869.jpg"></image-pro><p><strong>Fig. 8. </strong>Environmental and Sustainable Development Summit poster</p></image-pro><h3>Bioplus-China</h3><p>At the invitation of Bioplus-China, we participated in the <strong>Synthetic Biology Exchange meeting</strong> on August 5. Other teams participating in this meeting were Bioplus-Shanghai, ZJU-China, and OTIA-Hangzhou. At the meeting, we actively<strong> talk about ideas and provide advice and help</strong> for each other&apos;s projects.</p><p>At the invitation of Bioplus-China, we have <strong>set up a science education booth</strong> with Bioplus-Shanghai, ZJU-China, and OTIA-Hangzhou in Hangzhou Low Carbon Science and Technology Museum, China, to promote synthetic biology, iGEM competition, and our project to visitors. Together, we <strong>call on more people to join in the shaping of synthetic biology.This is a good way to</strong> <strong>increase the influence of iGEM competition in China</strong>, and <strong>promote the spread of synthetic biology in China</strong>.</p><!-- WikiBreeze coll1 end-->

      <p>This year, we worked with the BPI-China team to share the wiki building process and technical details. We also invited them to experience our wiki tool Wikibreeze, and they have provided us with a lot of valuable advice during the experience.</p>

          <p>This year, both our team and HBUT-China have developed a software (Wikibreeze and iGEM-uploads) to improve the efficiency of wiki development, so we experienced each other's team's software and worked together to improve the tools, which significantly contributed to the iGEM community.</p>

  <h3>SZU-China</h3>
  <p>SZU-China contacted us through the iGEM China Team Liaison Group,and had a friendly exchange on the experimental design as both of our teams intend to use Bacillus subtilis in our chassis biology this year. In the process of communication, we found that SZU-China needed pMA5 plasmid, and our team happened to have a lot of it, so we sent the plasmid to SZU-China. SZU-China also provided some suggestions and help for the experimental design of our degradation module.
On August 5, SZU-China participated in the special academic forum on Bioremediation organized by us, contributing to the success of the forum.</p>
