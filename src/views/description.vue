            <div><!-- WikiBreeze P1.2 start--><h2>Inspiration</h2><p>In the early satge of the project, we came up with a lot of wild ideas. In an accidental opportunity, we participated in the field study practice class organized by the school. In the practical class, we found that there are many plastic fragments in the soil, some even buried deep in the soil. In view of this unfavorable phenomenon to the natural environment, we have carried on a discussion. In the discussion, we analyzed various plastic pollution phenomena that exist in our lives. These phenomena got us thinking: Where do they come from? And where do they end? So we began to look extensively at the literature to understand the current state of plastic degradation and find out where we could attack it. We look forward to doing our part to protect the earth&apos;s natural environment.</p><h3><strong>The issue</strong></h3><p><strong>It does prove to be a problem! </strong>In 2018, The New York Times reported that microplastic particles in more than nine different materials, including polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate, within the human body. Once more, in a 2019 study, the European Intestinal Society documented the discovery of nine distinct plastic particles in the feces of research participants from eight countries and regions around the world. These findings have instilled a sense of urgency regarding the plastic pollution predicament.If we can put forward <strong>certain solutions </strong>to solve the problem of plastic pollution, then it will might be <strong>of great significance</strong>.</p><p>Therefore, we focused on <strong>solving the problem of plastic pollution</strong> and <strong>conducted a lot of literature research</strong>. We found that<strong> PET , as a mainstream plastic</strong>, is often used in the production of plastic water bottles, plastic mulch, plastic shopping bags and numerous other plastic products.</p><p>PET, scientifically known as polyethylene terephthalate, serves as a core material for production of the majority of the plastic products. Apart from the convenience this material brings to <strong>us, PET accounts for 12% of the world&apos;s solid waste</strong>. Theoretically, PET can be degraded into monomers through rapid enzymatic hydrolysis, subsequently enabling re-polymerization or upcycling into other valuable products, thereby <strong>achieving a circular carbon economy of PET</strong>.</p><h3>Current solution</h3><p>In China, the treatment of plastic pollution <strong>depends</strong> <strong>still on incineration or landfill</strong>, while the current incineration capacity of plastic urban solid waste in China stands at approximately <strong>800,000 tons/day</strong>, <strong>highlighting the severity of the plastic pollution issue.</strong></p><p>Between 1950 and 2015, <strong>6.3 billion tons of primary and secondary (recycled) plastic waste </strong>was generated worldwide, of which about 9% was recycled,12% was incinerated, and the remaining 79% was either stored in landfills or released directly into the natural environment. This data underscores that <strong>the main treatment methodof plastic waste in the world is also incineration or landfill</strong>.</p><p>The landfill method not only <strong>degrades plastics slowly andoccupies large area,but also may cause groundwater pollution</strong>. Incineration, on the other hand, releases harmful gases and other substances into the atmosphere. Both methods would <strong>cause irreparable damage to the environment</strong>.</p><p>We visited the local enterprise, Hangzhou Environmental Group, to conduct field research. The real-world situation aligns closely with the findings of literature. Please visit the Human Practice page for more information.</p><p>Our solution</p><p>We have conducted a series of research on PET plastics and designed <strong><em>Bacillus</em>-based spontaneous</strong> PET remediation solution for promoting the <strong>sustainable environmental practices</strong>.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>Our project aims to offer a <strong>dependable solution for remediation of the environment</strong> based on providing a new solution for PET degradation. To achieve this goal, we have designed a total of <strong>five modules:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Degradation Module</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Reporting Module</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Adhesion Module</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Suicide Switch</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Flip Module</strong></p></li></ul><p>We chose <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> as our chassis organism. This bacteria is commonly used in industry with excellent protein secretion capabilities and is included in the GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) list. In addition, its high resistance to harsh environments allows it to withstand extreme environmental conditions.</p><!-- WikiBreeze P1.2 end-->
